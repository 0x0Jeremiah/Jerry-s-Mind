Project Description:
The "Social Analyzer" mobile app is designed to connect to your social media accounts and provide insights into your daily activity. The app retrieves data such as the number of likes and comments you made in a day and identifies the most frequently used words in your posts and comments. By analyzing this data, the app aims to help you gain a better understanding of your social media habits and engagement patterns.
In this code, we import the necessary components from React Native (View, Text, Button) and set up a functional component called App. Inside the component, we use the useState hook to define state variables likesCount, commentsCount, and mostUsedWords.

On component mount, the useEffect hook is called, which triggers the fetchSocialMediaData function. This function makes an API request to your backend API's URL to retrieve the social media data. The received data is then used to update the state variables.

The JSX code renders the retrieved data, displaying the total likes and comments count, as well as the list of most used words. Finally, a "Refresh" button is provided to allow the user to manually fetch the latest data from the API.
